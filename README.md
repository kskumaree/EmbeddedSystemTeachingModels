# EmbeddedSystemTeachingModels
Models are built to demistify the complex embedded system design concepts specifically for Electrical and Electronics, Instrumentation engineering students

Summary:
Hardware models built for following courses:
MCOA506L, MCOA506P –Real Time Embedded Systems
EEE4020 –Embedded System Design
This prototype models are integrated in the education of embedded system design course. These prototypes are designed to drive students to a deeper understanding and integration of the diverse theoretical concepts that often come from different disciplines such as digital/analog electronics, sensors, control systems, communication and programming. Rather than proposing the experiment for a particular course within an embedded system engineering curriculum, this prototypes describes how the experiment can be tailored to the needs and diverse background of both undergraduate and graduate students’ education.
